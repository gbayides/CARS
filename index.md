## CARS - Child Alert and Rescue System

Our system is designed with your child in mind. With state of the art sensing techniques, we can detect if your child is in danger, alert you of the danger, and take action to rescue your child from harm.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
